\section{GPL licensed software}

Both versions of the GNU General Public License explicitly distinguish the
distribution of the source code from that of the binaries: On the one hand, the
GPL-V2 mainly talks about copying and distributing the source
code\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §1, §2]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}, but also mentions
the specific conditions for \enquote{[\ldots] (copying) and (distributing) the
Program [\ldots] in object code or executable form
[\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. On the other
hand, the GPL-V3 describes the \enquote{Basic Permissions} and the conditions
for \enquote{Conveying Verbatim Copies} or for \enquote{Conveying Modified
Source Versions}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2, §4, §5]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}
before it explains the rules for \enquote{Conveying
Non-Source-Forms}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2, §4, §5]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}.
Additionally, GPL-V2 and GPL-V3 mainly talk about copying \emph{and}
distributing the software; the private use is nearly complete
unspecified\footnote{The GPL-V2 lists its 'restrictions' only with respect to
the act of copying \emph{and} distributing \enquote{copies of the program}
(\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §1, §2, §4 et passim; emphasizings by
KR]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}) while the GPL-V3 explicitly specifies that one
\enquote{[\ldots] may make, run and propagate covered works that (one does) not
convey, without conditions so long as (the) license otherwise remains in force}
(\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}).}. Finally, the GPL-V2 and
the GPL-V3 are aiming for the same results and the same spirit by requiring
nearly the same license fulfilling tasks. Last but not least, with respect to
the use of an unmodified or a modified library as an embedded component, a
license with a strong copyleft evokes that also the application which is using
the (un)modified library has to be licensed under the same conditions as the
library itself. Therefore it is appropriate to cover both versions by the same
chapter and to offer the same more sophisticated GPL specific open source use
case structure\footnote{For details of the general OSUC finder $\rightarrow$

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item The GPL-V2 allows to \enquote{[\ldots] copy \emph{and} (to)
  distribute verbatim copies of the Program's complete source code as you
  receive it [...] provided that you [a] conspicuously and appropriately publish
  on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; [b]
  keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
  any warranty; and [c] distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Program}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §1, emphasizes by
  KR]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. Additionally, the GPL-V2 allows to
  \enquote{[\ldots] copy and distribute [\ldots] modifications (of the Program
  or any portion of it) [\ldots] under the terms of Section
  1}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a} while it allows to
  distribute binaries \enquote{under the terms of Sections 1 and
  2}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §4]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. But the GPL does not
  require any tasks if you are using the work only for yourself. Thus, the
  quoted conditions of \enquote{Section 1} are mandatory for all use cases
  concerning the distribution of an GPL licensed work (GPL-C2 - GPL-CB)\footnote{
  \label{Gpl3ConditionsDistri}
  The GPL-V3 uses a similar structure to establish the same requirements:
  In §4 it allows to \enquote{[\ldots] convey verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it [\ldots] provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
  intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
  added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of
  the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License
  along with the Program}. Additionally in §5 it also allows to
  \enquote{[\ldots] convey [\ldots] modifications [\ldots] under the terms of
  section 4 [\ldots]} and in §6 it allows to \enquote{[\ldots] convey a covered
  work in object form under the terms of sections of 4 and 5}
  (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §4, §5, §6]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}). In opposite to
  the GPL-V2, the GPL-V3 explicitly states that one \enquote{[\ldots] may
  make, run and propagate covered works that (one) (does) not convey
  [distribute], without conditions so long as (the GPL-V3) license otherwise
  remains in force} (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}).
  Moreover, giving a package to a third party for getting a modified version
  back has not to be taken as a case of distribution if the modification has
  only been executed on behalf and only for the purpose of the purchaser and if
  the modified version is not distributed to any third party (\cite[cf.][\nopage
  wp.\ §2]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}). If one collects all these GPL-V3 statements
  together, than one may conclude that the tasks which fulfill the corresponding
  GPL-V2 requirements together also fit the GPL-V3 conditions.}.
  
  \item The GPL-V2 allows to \enquote{[\ldots] copy and (to) distribute the
  Program (or a work based on it [\ldots]) in object code or executable form
  [\ldots] provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code [\ldots] on a medium customarily used for
  software interchange}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3,
  §3a]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. As a substitution for this basic condition, the
  GPL-V2 allows to \enquote{accompany} the binary distribution package
  \enquote{[\ldots] with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
  give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
  performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
  corryponding source code [\ldots] on a medium customarily used for software
  interchange}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3b]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. The OSLiC
  construes the common technique to download files from the internet as a
  distribution \emph{on a medium [being today] customarily used for software
  interchange}. Therefore, the OSLiC requires for all open source use cases
  which refer to the distribution of binaries (GPL-C3, GPL-C7, GPL-C9, GPL-CB) to
  make the corresonding source code of the library itself accessible via an
  internet repository under your own control\footnote{\label{Gpl3CondCopyleft}
  Also the GPL-V3 explicitly requires to make the source code accessible in
  case of distributing binaries. But in opposite to the GPL-V2, the GPL-V3
  explicitly offers the option that giving the \enquote{[\ldots] access to copy
  the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge} would fulfill the
  conditions (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §6 and §6b]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}). So
  again, the tasks which ensure to act in accordance to the GPL-V2 license in
  case of distributing binaries, also fulfill the conditions of the GPL-V3}.
  The weakness that in this case \enquote{third parties [which have received the
  binaries] are not compelled to copy the source code [\ldots]} is mediately
  accepted by the GPL\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3, at the
  end]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. But the necessity to offer the source code via a
  repository being controled by yourself (mostly) may not be circumvented: The
  GPL-V2 allows to redistribute a link to an external source code repository
  only in case of \enquote{noncommercial distributions}\footcite[cf.][\nopage
  wp.\ §3c]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}.
  
  \item Both, the GPL-V2 and the GPL-V3 allow to \enquote{[\ldots] modify your
  copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it [\ldots] and (to) copy and
  distribute such modifications [\ldots]} only under very similar restrictions
  and conditions\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First, modified files must be marked as modifications and marked by
    the date of the modification\footnote{For GPL-V2 see \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
    §2]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. For GPL-V3 see \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
    §5]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}}. These conditions must be respected by all open
    source use cases concerning the distribution of the modified work [GPL-C6 -
    GPL -9], because even if one primarily intends to distribute binaries, one
    has lateron also to deliver the source code. The OSLiC rewrites this
    requirement by the mandatory condition to mark each modified file and by the
    voluntary condition to update / generate a general changing file.
    
    \item Second, the GPL requires that all copies of the modified software
    which are using an interactive interface or a method to display messages
    must \enquote{[\ldots] print or display an announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty [\ldots]
    and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
    telling the user how to view a copy of this License}\footnote{For GPL-V2
    see \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2c]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. For GPL-V3 see
    \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §5d]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}}. The OSLiC rewrites this
    condition in the form that the work shall let its copyright dialog clearly
    reproduce the content of the existing copyright notices, a hint to the
    software name, a link to its homepage, the respective disclaimer of
    warranty, and a link to the GPL-V2-file resp. the GPL-V3-file which has to
    be delivered together with the software. These conditions have to be
    respected if one redistributes the received and then modified programs
    (GPL-C6, GPL-C7) or if one distributes own programs which are using (modified)
    libraries as embedded components (GPL-CA, GPL-CB). For those open source use
    cases which concern the redistribution of  received and modified libraries
    etc., the OSLiC does not mention these requirements because libraries,
    plugins, or snippets normally do not offer their own copyright dialogs.
    
    \item Third, the GPL requires to \enquote{ [\ldots] cause any work (being
    distributed or published), that in whole or in part contains or is derived
    from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
    to all third parties under the terms of this (GPL)}\footnote{For GPL-V2 see
    cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2b]{Gpl20OsiLicense1991a}. For GPL-V3 see
    cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §5c]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}}. This requirement does
    not depend of the form in which the software is distributed. The OSLiC
    adopts this statement in the following way:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For all open source use cases which concern the distribution (GPL-C2
      \ldots GPL-CB), the OSLiC rewrites this condition as the mandatory
      requirement to retain all existing licensing elements.
      
      \item For all use cases which deal with the distribution of a modified
      version of the software (GPL-C6 \ldots GPL-CB), the OSliC adds the
      requirement to organize the modifications in a way that they are covered
      by the respective GPL-V2 oder GPL-V3 licensing statements.
      
      \item For the use case which deal with the distribution of an embedded
      library (GPL-C4,GPL-C5,GPL-CA,GPL-CB) the OSLiC requires also to license
      the on-top development under the terms of the respective GPL-V2 or GPL-V3
      license.
    \end{itemize}
   
    \item Finally, as parts of those task lists which concern the distribution
    in the form of binaries, the OSLiC reminds the reader also to execute the
    corresponding source code use cases because distributing the binaries
    without making the corresponding sources accessible is not allowed by the
    GPL.
  \end{itemize}
