\section{EUPL licensed software}

The European Union Public License explicitly distinguishes the distribution
of the source code from that of the binaries: In the chapter
\enquote{Communication of the Source Code}, it allows to \enquote{provide the
Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable
Code}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง3]{EuplLicense2007en}. But if a piece of EUPL
licensed software is distributed as binary package, then the license
additionally requires that the distributor either \enquote{[\ldots] provides a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code [\ldots]} directly together with the
binaries\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en} or that he
\enquote{[\ldots] indicates [\ldots] a repository where the Source Code is
easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute
[\ldots] the Work}\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง3.]{EuplLicense2007en}}. For
respecting this conditions it is irrelevant whether the software has been
modified or not; and all the other \enquote{obligations of the licensee} refer
to both forms\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en}. 

But there is a specific aspect which has to be considered for acting in
accordance to the EUPL: In the proper meaning of the words, the EUPL is a
license with a weak copy left, no doubt. But this character is only evoked by
the fact that the EUPL allows the licensee to relicense the software by
following the conditions of a specific clause and an licenses listed in an
appendix which also lists some licenses with a weak copy
left.\footnote{($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\ \pageref{sec:ProtectingPowerOfEupl})}.
Thus, with respect to question how to fulfill the license best, it is safer to
treat the EUPL as a license with a default strong copy left. Concerning the use
of an unmodified or a modified library as an embedded component, a license with
a strong copy left evokes that also the application which is using the
(un)modified library has to be licensed under the same conditions as the library
itself. Thus, for finding the simply processable task lists, the following EUPL
specific and a little more sophisticated open source use case
structure\footnote{For details of the general OSUC finder $\rightarrow$ OSLiC,

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}
\begin{itemize}
  
  \item The EUPL generally \enquote{[\ldots] does not grant permission to use
  the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except
  as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
  Work and reproducing the content of the copyright
  notice}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en}. Therefore, the OSLiC
  genreally interdicts (EUPL-C1 - EUPL-CB) to promote any service or product --
  based on this software -- by such elements.

  \item The EUPL generally requires that \enquote{[\ldots] the Licensee shall
  keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that
  refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of
  warranties}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en}. In a very strict
  reading, the EUPL does not limit this requirement to the distribution of the
  software. But practically, it will be impossible to control the compliant use
  of the software in those cases (\emph{4yourself}) without 'switching' into the
  use case 'distribution'. Therefore the OSLiC only inserts this requirement as
  a mandatory clause for the \emph{2others} use cases (EUPL-C2 - EUPL-CB).
  
  \item The EUPL also requires to \enquote{[\ldots] include [\ldots] a copy of
  the (EUPL) Licence with every (distributed) copy of the Work
  [\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en}. Therefore, all
  \emph{2others} use cases contain the respective mandatory condition (EUPL-C2 -
  EUPL-CB).
  
  \item Additionally, the EUPL requires that the \enquote{licensee} who
  distributes a modified work \enquote{[\ldots] must cause any Derivative Work
  to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the
  date of modification}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en}. Thus,
  the OSLiC integrates the mandatory requirement to generate (update) a
  respective notice file into all 'modification use cases and recommends to mark
  all modifications in the source code (EUPL-C6 - EUPL-CB)
  
  \item Furthermore, the EUPL requires that any distributor of the software
  \enquote{[\ldots] provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code [\ldots]}
  by \enquote{[\ldots] (indicating) a repository where this Source will be
  easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to
  distribute [\ldots] the Work}\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en}. To be precise, the EUPL also allows to directly
  distribute the source code together with the binary packages
  (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ ยง3]{EuplLicense2007en}). With respect to the OSLiC
  principle to offer only one reliable way, the OSLiC simplifies this option:
  It 'only' asks for the repository solution.}. Therefore the OSLiC inserts a
  respective requirement into the task list of all cases concerning a binary
  distribution  (EUPL-C3, EUPL-C7, EUPL-C9, EUPL-CB)
  
  \item Finally, the EUPL contains a \enquote{copyleft clause} stating that if a
  \enquote{[\ldots] Licensee distributes [\ldots] copies of the Original Works
  or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution [...] will
  be done under the terms of this (EUPL) Licence [\ldots]}. In all the use cases
  which do not concern the use of an embedded component (EUPL-C2 - EUPL-C9) this
  copyleft clause is already fulfilled by either distributing the modified
  sources themselves of by making them accessible via a repository. In those
  cases where the licensee distributes an overarching program which uses an EUPL
  licensed component (EUPL-CA - EUPL-CB) normally also the code of the overarching
  work must be distributed. Thus, with respect to the use case (EUPL-CA) this is
  already fulfilled by definition. So, the OSLiC only mentions this default view
  in the case EUPL-CB and therefore implicitly evokes a strong copyleft effect of
  the EUPL\footnote{Formally, the EUPL-1.1 is a license with weak copyleft. But
  this is only a result of the allowance to relicense the software
  ($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\ \pageref{sec:ProtectingPowerOfEupl}). So, as long as
  you do not relicense the embedded library with respect to the list of
  \enquote{compatible licenses according to article 5 EUPL}, you also have to
  publish the code of your overarching work. Therefore, you can only avoid this
  consequence by relicensing the embedded component by one of the compatible
  licenses with a weak copyleft listed in the EUPL appendix (\cite[cf.][\nopage
  wp ยง5 and Appendix]{EuplLicense2007en})}.
