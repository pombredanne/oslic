\section{BSD licensed software}

As an approved open source license, the BSD license exists in two
versions\footcite[Following the OSI, there is another 'ancient' 
BSD license -- containing a fourth clause known as advertising clause -- which
\enquote{(\ldots) officially was rescinded by the Director of the Office of
Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999}.
 Cf.][\nopage wp.\ Because of that cancellation you can simply act according the
 \textit{BSD 3-Clause license} if you have to fulfill the eldest BSD
 license]{BsdLicense3Clause}. The latest release is the \textit{BSD 2-Clause
 license}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{BsdLicense2Clause}, the elder release is the
 \textit{BSD 3-Clause license}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{BsdLicense3Clause}.
 The very little differences between the two versions have to be respected
 exactly. Nevertheless, we could integrate the requirements into one to-do list
 per use case.

Explicitly, all BSD open source licenses 'only' focus on the (re-)distribution
\textit{open source use cases} which we have specified by our token
\textit{2others}. Conditions for the other use cases specified by the token
\textit{4yourself} can be derived\footnote{For details of the \textit{open
source use case tokens} see p.\ \pageref{OsucTokens}. For details of the
\textit{open source use cases} based on these token see p.
\pageref{OsucDefinitionTree} }. Additionally the BSD licenses consider the form
of the distribution, esp.\ whether the work is distributed as a (set of) source
code file(s) or as a (set of) the binary file(s). Use the following tree to find
the BSD license fulfilling to-do lists.

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

The \textit{BSD 2-Clause license} has a simple structure: In the
beginning, it generally \enquote{(permits) [the] redistribution and [the] use in
source and binary forms, with or without modification, [\ldots]}, if one
fulfills the two rules of the license\footcite[cf.][\nopage
wp]{BsdLicense2Clause}. The first rule concerns the (re)distribution in the form of
source code, the second the (re)distribution of binary packages. Here are some
explanations why we translated the rules into which sets of executable tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item For the \enquote{redistribution of source code}, the license requires
that the package must \enquote{ [\ldots] retain the above copyright notice, this
list of conditions and the following disclaimer}\footcite[cf.][\nopage
wp]{BsdLicense2Clause}. Hence, you are not allowed to modify any of the
copyright notes which are already embedded in the received (source) files. And
from a logical point of view, there must exist an explicit or implicit
assertion that the software is licensed under the \textit{BSD 2-Clause
license}\footcite[The BSD license requires that a re-distributed software
package must contain the (package specific) copyright notice, the (license
specific) conditions and the BSD disclaimer. (cf.][\nopage wp) You might ask
what you should do, if these elements are missing in the package you received. If so,
the package you received had not been licensed adequately. Hence, you do not know
reliably whether you have received it under a BSD license. In other words: If
you have received a BSD licensed software package, it must contain sufficient
license fulfilling elements, or it is not a BSD licensed
software]{BsdLicense2Clause}. This is often implemented by simply adding a copy
of the license into the package. Hence, you are furthermore not allowed to
modify these files or corresponding text snippets. For our purposes, we
translated the bans into the following executable task:

\begin{quote}\textit{Ensure that the licensing elements -- esp.\ the BSD license
text, the specific copyright notice of the original author(s), and the BSD
disclaimer -- are retained in your package in the form you have received
them.}\end{quote}

\item For the redistribution in the form of binary files, the license requires, that
the licensing elements must be \enquote{[\ldots] (reproduced) in the
documentation and/or other materials provided with the
distribution}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{BsdLicense2Clause}. Hence, this is not
required as a necessary condition for the (re)distribution as source code
package. But nevertheless, even for a distribution in the form of source code, it is
often possible to fulfill this rule too -- e.g.\ if you offer your own download
site for source code packages. In such cases, it is a sign of respect to
mention the licensing not only inside of the packages, but also in the text of
your site. Because of that, we added the following voluntary task for all BSD
open source use cases which deal with the redistribution in the form of source code:

\begin{quote}\textit{Let the documentation of your distribution and/or your
additional material also contain the original copyright notice, the BSD
conditions, and the BSD disclaimer.}\end{quote}

\item Naturally, because the reproduction of the licensing elements \enquote{in
the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution}
is explicitly required for the \enquote{redistribution in binary
form}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{BsdLicense2Clause}, we had to rewrite the
facultative task for a distribution in the form of source code as a mandatory task
for all BSD open source use cases which deals with the redistribution in binary
form:

\begin{quote}\textit{Ensure that the documentation of your distribution and/or
your additional material also contains the author specific copyright notice, the
BSD conditions, and the BSD disclaimer.}\end{quote}

\item In case of (re)distributing the program in the form of binary files, it is
sometimes not enough, to pass the licensing elements as one has received them.
If you compile the binary package from the source code, it is not necessarily
true, that the licensing elements are also automatically generated and embedded
into the 'binary package'. But nevertheless, you have to add the copyright
notice, the conditions and the disclaimer to this package for acting according
to the BSD license. Therefore we chose the following form of an executable,
license fulfilling task for all binary oriented distributions:

\begin{quote}\textit{Ensure that your distribution contains the original
copyright notice, the BSD license, and the BSD disclaimer in the form you have
received them. If you compile the binary file on the base of the source code
package and if this compilation does not also generate and integrate the
licensing files, then create the copyright notice the BSD conditions, and the
BSD disclaimer according to the form of the source code package and insert these
files into your distribution manually.}\end{quote}

\item Finally, we wished to insert a hint to the general (open source)
tradition, to mention the used open source software and their licenses as a
remark of the 'copyright widget' of an application. This is not required by the
BSD license. But it is a general, good tradition. Naturally, because of the
freedom to use and modify open source software and to redistribute a modified
