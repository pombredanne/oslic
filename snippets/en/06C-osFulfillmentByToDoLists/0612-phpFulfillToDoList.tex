\section{PHP licensed software}

The PHP-3.0 license contains a shade more conditions than the MIT license and
additionally distinguishes the \enquote{redistribution of source
code}\footcite[cf.][wp. ยง1]{Php30OsiLicense2013a} from the
\enquote{redistribution in binary form}\footcite[cf.][wp.
ยง2]{Php30OsiLicense2013a} . Nevertheless, the PHP license focusses only on the
redistribution or -- as we are going to say in the OSLiC -- \emph{the 2others use
cases}. Thus, the PHP specific finder can be simplified:

\tikzstyle{nodv} = [font=\small, ellipse, draw, fill=gray!10,

\tikzstyle{nods} = [font=\footnotesize, rectangle, draw, fill=gray!20, 
    text width=1.2cm, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=3em]

\tikzstyle{nodb} = [font=\footnotesize, rectangle, draw, fill=gray!20, 
    text width=2.2cm, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=3em]

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

\label{sec:PhpDiscussions}

First of all, it might surprise some readers that the OSLiC also describes the
open source use cases which concern the distribution of binary files although it
deals with the PHP license. PHP is a script language. Thus, delivering the
source code seems to be a must. But one has to consider that the PHP license
could also be applied to works which are based on other languages constituted on
the compiler paradigm. Or there might a PHP compiler be used.

It might also surprise some readers that in case of the binary distribution of
modifications the condition to repoduce the php license in the documentation is
a \emph{must}, while its reproduction in a copyright screen of the program is a
\emph{should}. This is directly evoked by the binary-condition of the php license
which expressly requires that \enquote{Redistributions in binary form must
reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following
disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
distribution}\footcite[cf.][wp. ยง2]{Php30OsiLicense2013a}. But of course, to
implement the \emph{must} and the \emph{should} is the best.
